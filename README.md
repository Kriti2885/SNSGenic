### Problem Statement
The intent of this work is to gather sufficient evidence that is indicative of effect of social media on mental health. There are three main research questions:

• Can Sentiment scores, frequency, subjectivity scores, post length, social media keyword count on general comments be used as an indicator of poster mood(as evidenced by participation in mental health subreddits)?

• What terms occur most often in posts where social media has demonstrated mental health impact?

• What can be used as a meaningful input to a machine learning model to identify posts where social media has demonstrated mental health impact ?
